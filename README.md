#About
This file contains the supporting documentation for my app. This app is a prototype that will allow anyone who is interested in 
the chemical constituents of their food to learn about the potential risks or benefits of their favorite foods. 

For simplicity, this app only contains seven types of fruit, but in future iterations I hope to expand the available choices to include more types of food (vegetables, spices, animal products, etc.).

#How to use
The app is designed to be very simple. To use it, simply choose a fruit of interest from the drop-down menu and click "submit." You will then see an output consisting of a large table with two columns. 

The left column contains the full names of the chemical constituents present, and the right column lists the known health effects associated with each compound. Since many compounds have mutiple health effects, they appear multiple times in the table, but with a different health effect for each entry.

When you are done reading the table, you can select another fruit from the drop-down menu and click "submit" again to repeat the process as many times as desired.
